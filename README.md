# LegoRobot
LEGO Boost based robots in Python

Based on current version of https://github.com/undera/pylgbst

I've extended the library for createing these two robots:

## Plotter

Addig a pen, this robot can drive over some paper writing simple text and lines.

In Action:

## Egg painter

After some modifications the plotter robot can now draw eggs. :)
